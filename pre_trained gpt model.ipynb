      "1. Create a spreadsheet\n",
      "1. Create a spreadsheet\n",
      "More likely than not, youâre planning on applying to more than one scholarship. Whether itâs just a few, dozens, or far more, doing so is a good idea. Putting your âeggsâ (i.e. applications) in multiple baskets will improve your chances of winning one (or hopefully, more than one!). However, applying to so many scholarships can sometimes make it hard to keep up with your requirements and deadlines for all of them. After choosing or finding a preferred spreadsheet program, use it to keep track of the following info for each scholarship youâre interested in:\n",
      "The name of the scholarship\n",
      "The provider/organization\n",

      "2. Demonstrate strong writing skills\n",
      "Strong writing skills can also enhance your scholarship applications. For one, âgoodâ writing shows scholarship committees that youâre ready for college- or graduate-level coursework.

      "4. Gather references\n",
      "4. Gather references\n",
      "Simply, references are people whose names and contact information you give to an organization. These are typically given when applying to jobs, but can also be used for other applications â like those for scholarships! What exactly are references used for, though?\n",
      "Great question! Organizations use references to hear firsthand about their applicantsâ work ethic, positive traits, and other capabilities. Thus, if any of your scholarships require a list of references, itâs best to write down former teachers, professors, or employers who youâve had positive experiences with. Relatives and friends, on the other hand, should not be listed as references as they may be considered biased sources.\n",
      "Before listing anyone as a reference, we would also recommend letting them know beforehand. This way, you can (1) make sure theyâre comfortable with it and (2) ensure that theyâll be ready if they get a call to speak on your behalf.\n",

      "1. Not writing your own essay\n",
      "Although you may sometimes feel inspired by essays you see on the internet, or even your own past submitted essays, itâs always best to come up with completely original material when submitting an essay for an application.\n",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, scholarship committees are very familiar with the range of what students typically write in scholarship essays. Thus, they will likely be able to tell whether an essay truly depicts your potential and abilities, or not.\n",
      "It is thus best to completely write your essay yourself, inspired by the thoughts from your own mind and the passions of your heart. Afterwards, however, we would definitely recommend having a trusted person (ideally a grammar-whiz) review and proofread your essay for any mistakes. Donât forget to spellcheck!\n",
      "2. Waiting until the last minute to apply\n",
      "2. Waiting until the last minute to apply\n",
      "This may very well seem a little obvious to many readers, but we would highly recommend against waiting until the last minute to apply for scholarships. Doing so may make you rush your applications and result in you submitting sub-par essays and other materials. Thus, we would recommend starting the application a few months before the deadline. This way, youâll have plenty of time to (1) write beautiful essays, (2) collect and submit all necessary materials, and (3) gather necessary references.\n",
      "3. Applying to few scholarships\n",
      "3. Applying to few scholarships\n",
      "No matter how confident you feel in any of your scholarship applications, it never hurts to apply to multiple (or many). In fact, one of the biggest mistakes students make when applying to scholarships is not applying to enough (trust me).\n",
      "Your chances of winning a scholarship are never harmed by the fact that you applied to another. Thus, we would highly, highly recommend that students save themselves from the mistake of applying to just a few. Applying to more scholarships increases your chances of winning one, so make sure to do just that!\n",
