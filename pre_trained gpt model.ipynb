Transfer scholarships are based on portfolio and college GPA. All college transcripts are included in the calculation. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.5 GPA to renew their scholarships each year. No separate scholarship application is required for consideration.\n",

However, applying to so many scholarships can sometimes make it hard to keep up with your requirements and deadlines for all of them. After choosing or finding a preferred spreadsheet program, use it to keep track of the following info for each scholarship you’re interested in:\n",

      "4. Gather references\n",
      "Simply, references are people whose names and contact information you give to an organization. These are typically given when applying to jobs, but can also be used for other applications – like those for scholarships! What exactly are references used for, though?\n",
      "Great question! Organizations use references to hear firsthand about their applicants’ work ethic, positive traits, and other capabilities. Thus, if any of your scholarships require a list of references, it’s best to write down former teachers, professors, or employers who you’ve had positive experiences with. Relatives and friends, on the other hand, should not be listed as references as they may be considered biased sources.\n",
      "Before listing anyone as a reference, we would also recommend letting them know beforehand. This way, you can (1) make sure they’re comfortable with it and (2) ensure that they’ll be ready if they get a call to speak on your behalf.\n",
      "5. Don’t be afraid to ask for help\n",
      "5. Don’t be afraid to ask for help\n",
      "Last, but certainly not least, don’t be afraid to ask for help! If you need help completing any parts of your applications, reach out to the contacts listed on each of your scholarship applications. They should be able to answer any of your questions and guide you in the right direction.\n",

      "Scholarship mistakes to avoid\n",
      "Just like there are plenty of ways that one can improve their chances of winning a scholarship, there are also plenty of things that may hurt one’s chances. Here are a few things you should avoid doing when it comes to applying to scholarships:\n",
      "1. Not writing your own essay\n",
      "1. Not writing your own essay\n",
      "Although you may sometimes feel inspired by essays you see on the internet, or even your own past submitted essays, it’s always best to come up with completely original material when submitting an essay for an application.\n",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, scholarship committees are very familiar with the range of what students typically write in scholarship essays. Thus, they will likely be able to tell whether an essay truly depicts your potential and abilities, or not.\n",
      "It is thus best to completely write your essay yourself, inspired by the thoughts from your own mind and the passions of your heart. Afterwards, however, we would definitely recommend having a trusted person (ideally a grammar-whiz) review and proofread your essay for any mistakes. Don’t forget to spellcheck!\n",
      "2. Waiting until the last minute to apply\n",
      "2. Waiting until the last minute to apply\n",
      "This may very well seem a little obvious to many readers, but we would highly recommend against waiting until the last minute to apply for scholarships. Doing so may make you rush your applications and result in you submitting sub-par essays and other materials. Thus, we would recommend starting the application a few months before the deadline. This way, you’ll have plenty of time to (1) write beautiful essays, (2) collect and submit all necessary materials, and (3) gather necessary references.\n",
      "3. Applying to few scholarships\n",
      "3. Applying to few scholarships\n",
      "No matter how confident you feel in any of your scholarship applications, it never hurts to apply to multiple (or many). In fact, one of the biggest mistakes students make when applying to scholarships is not applying to enough (trust me).\n",
      "Your chances of winning a scholarship are never harmed by the fact that you applied to another. Thus, we would highly, highly recommend that students save themselves from the mistake of applying to just a few. Applying to more scholarships increases your chances of winning one, so make sure to do just that!\n",

To find out whether you are, we would recommend checking with your university’s financial aid office regarding eligibility requirements.
